# Transitland Atlas

An open catalog of transit/mobility data feeds and operators.

This catalog is used to power the canonical [Transitland](https://transit.land) platform, is available for distributed used of the [transitland-lib](https://github.com/interline-io/transitland-lib) tooling, and is open to use as a "crosswalk" within other transportation data systems.

## Feeds

Public mobility/transit data feeds cataloged in the [Distributed Mobility Feed Registry](https://github.com/transitland/distributed-mobility-feed-registry) format.

Includes feeds in the following data specifications (specs):

- [GTFS](https://gtfs.org/reference/static)
- [GTFS Realtime](https://gtfs.org/reference/realtime/v2/)
- [GBFS](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs) - automatically synchronized from https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs/blob/master/systems.csv
- [MDS](https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification) - automatically synchronized from https://github.com/openmobilityfoundation/mobility-data-specification/blob/main/providers.csv

## How to Add a New Feed

1. Check if a `./feeds` file exists with the domain name for the feed URL. (ex. `http://bart.gov` -> `bart.gov.dmfr.json`)
    * If a file exists, use that file, otherwise create a new empty DMFR file.
    * To create a new file, you can use `example.com.dmfr.json` as a starting point, which contains the basic schema and an example feed.
    * Feeds exist as an array in the `feeds` property of a DMFR file.
2. Propose a new Onestop ID for the feed (see [below](#onestop-ids))
    * Feed Onestop ID's begins with `f-` and continues with a unique string, like the transit operator's name
    * Use lowercase, alphanumeric unicode characters  in the name component
    * Use `~` instead of spaces or other punctuation
3. Add the appropriate URL to `static_current`
4. Add license and/or authorization metadata if you are aware of it.
5. Open a PR. Feel free to add any questions as a comment on the PR if you are uncertain about your DMFR file.
6. GitHub Actions (continuous integration service) will run a basic validation check on your PR and report any errors.
7. A moderator will review and comment on your PR. If you don't get a response shortly, feel free to ping us at [hello@transit.land](mailto:hello@transit.land)

If you are using the Github web interface, you can click "Add a file -> Create a new file" in the `./feeds` directory, or when viewing an individual existing file, the pencil icon in the upper right of the contents display. Make sure to select "Create a new branch for this commit" and begin creating a pull request to propose changes.

For more information on what can go into a DMFR file, see the [DMFR documentation](https://github.com/transitland/distributed-mobility-feed-registry).

## How to Update an Existing Feed

1. Find the DMFR file containing the feed.
2. Update the URLs and other properties for that feed
    * For static feeds, use `static_current` for the present URL.
    * Add the previous URL value to the `static_historic` array.
3. Edit the file and open the PR as described above.

Onestop ID values for feeds and operators are used to synchronize with existing values in the Transitland database. Editing the Onestop ID value will cause a new feed or operator record to be created; values in the database that are no longer present in the Transitland Atlas will be marked as soft-deleted. Use caution and clear intent when changing a Onestop ID value.

## Operators

[Operators](https://transit.land/operators) describe, annotate, and group data from different feed data sources. For example, `o-9q9-actransit` describes a transit operator, Alameda-Contra Costa Transit District, which pulls from two different data sources (one GTFS-RT, one static GTFS) and adds additional metadata such as a US National Transit Database ID.

Operators can exist in the top-level `operators` property if a DMFR file, or nested within a feed. An operator defined in the top-level `operators` property requires an `associated_feeds` value to connect the operator with data sources. When an operator is nested within a feed, there is an implicit association that all GTFS agencies contained in that file are associated with that operator, which helps reduces complexity and maintenance.

The key properties for an operator are:
* `onestop_id`: A OnestopID value for this operator, starting with `o-`
* `name`: A formal name for the operator, such as `Bay Area Rapid Transit`
* `short_name`: A simpler, colloqial name for an operator, such as `BART`
* `tags`: A set of key,value string pairs that provide additional metadata and references
* `website`: A URL to find more information about this operator
* `associated_feeds`: An array of feed association objects; for each entry, `feed_onestop_id` is required and `gtfs_agency_id` is optional

Values for `onestop_id` and `name` are required; `associated_feeds` (either explicit or through nesting the operator in a feed) are highly recommended.

## Onestop IDs

Every feed and operator record in the Atlas repository is identified by a unique [Onestop ID](https://transit.land/documentation/onestop-id-scheme/). Onestop IDs are meant to be globally unique (no duplicates in the world) and to be stable (no change over time).

To simplify the process of creating Onestop IDs, we now allow two different variants:

- a three-part Onestop ID includes an entity prefix, a geohash, and a name. For example: `f-9q9-bart`
- a two-part Onestop ID includes just the entity prefix and a name. For example: `f-banning~pass~transit`

The two-part Onestop ID is simpler to create if you are manually adding records to the Transitland Atlas repository.

Rules for Onestop IDs in this repository:

- Feeds start with `f-` and operators start with `o-`
- Geohash part is optional
- Name can include any alphanumeric characters in UTF-8
- The only separation or punctuation character allowed in the name component is a tilde (`~`)
